Simple project to test some things.

The Client/Servce consists of a server echoing a String back to the client.

I will try this using different techniques:
- plain jave method call: Client class invokes Server method
- REST Client/Server on a single JVM
- OSGi: equivalent of first approach but using a OSGi service
- REST on application server instances
- the last approach on different machines
